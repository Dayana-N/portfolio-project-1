The fonts used are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kanit?query=kanit) The main font of the website is Kanit and Sans-Serif is used as a fall back font.
### Images
The images used are from various sources which are linked in the credits section. The images were compressed to improve the performance of the website. 
### Wireframes
This website was design as scroll website with fixed navigation to help the user navigate easily through the website.
The initial idea for the experience cards was to have them with horizontal layout however due to the fact that the flow of information in the previous two sections was horizontal, decision was made for the cards to be vertical to break this pattern.

### Hero Section
The hero section presents the user with a strong and colorful image. The image was carefully selected with the idea to represent to the user the feeling of adrenaline that comes with such an experience. 
On the left side in the hero section the text "If You Can Dream It, You Can Drive It! Enjoy a one-on-one experience in the car of your dreams." gives the user a brief description of the purpose of the website. <br>
